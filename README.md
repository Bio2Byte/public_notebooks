## About Bio2Byte

Proteins are the molecular machines that make cells work. They perform a wide variety of functions through interactions with each other and many additional molecules. Traditionally, proteins are described in a single static state (a picture). It is now increasingly recognised that many proteins can adopt multiple states and move between these conformational states dynamically (a movie).

We investigate how the dynamics, conformational states and available experimental data of proteins relates to their amino acid sequence. Underlying physical and chemical principles are computationally unravelled through data integration, analysis and machine learning, so connecting them to biological events and improving our understanding of the way proteins work.

The Bio2Byte group is primarily situated at the Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels, a collaborative interfaculty institute between the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Université Libre de Bruxelles. It is located at the the ULB side of the Pleinlaan/La Plaine campus on the 6th floor of the C building.

At the VUB, the group is linked to Structural Biology Brussels at the Bioengineering sciences department, as well as the departments of Computer Science and Chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences, plus to the Biomedical sciences at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy.

## Public Notebooks
Welcome to the public repository of Jupyter Notebooks shared with the scientific community.

### List of available notebooks

- AlphaFold_+_B2B_Tools.ipynb: Run a set of biophysical feature predictions on top of an Alphafold thee-dimensional predicted structure.
- Bio2ByteTools_v3_multipleseq_pypi.ipynb: Example of usage of our Bio2Byte tools package for Multiple Sequence Alignment file inputs

- Bio2Byte_AlphaFold_Analysis.ipynb: From the output files generated from Alphafold, this notebook runs a set of biophysical feature prediction

### How to use them? 
1. Open the Jupyter notebook file of interest
1. There will be a "Open In Colab" button, if you click on it, a new session on Google Colab will be started
1. From the Google Colab session you will be able to run the code of the notebook.
